# 📚 Pustak Ghar – Preserving Hindi & Regional Literature

## Overview
Pustak Ghar is an open-source initiative dedicated to promoting Indian literature and reading culture by building a digital library of freely accessible Hindi and regional language books.

Our mission is to preserve literary heritage by curating, digitizing, and organizing books, poems, stories, and educational resources into a structured, user-friendly platform for readers, students, and literature enthusiasts.

> ⚠️ Important: This repository is not the “Pustak Ghar – Study Resources Platform” project. Please ensure you are contributing to the correct repository.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Preserve and promote Hindi & regional literature  
- Build a digital library-style platform accessible to everyone  
- Organize content into categories: Books, Poems, Stories, Educational Resources  
- Make the platform aesthetically literary with warm, inviting design  
- Ensure mobile-first accessibility and responsive design  

## ✨ Features (Planned)
- 📖 Book & Content Categories with search and filtering  
- 🎨 Warm, literary-themed color palette (cream, maroon, deep blue)  
- ✍️ Typography inspired by printed literature  
- 📱 Responsive & accessible UI  
- 📝 About Page highlighting mission and heritage preservation  
- 🌐 Open contributions for adding books, poems, and stories  

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js (recommended for combined frontend & backend development)  
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS  
- **Database / Content Storage:** TBD (JSON, Markdown, or API integration)  
- **Deployment:** Vercel / Netlify  

## 🚧 Current Status
The current site design does not reflect the actual vision of the project. It resembles a study resources platform rather than a digital literature library. We are completely redesigning the UI and structure to align with the true mission.

## 🔄 Redesign Guidelines
- Replace current layout with digital library UI  
- Add sections for Books, Poems, Stories, Educational Resources  
- Implement search filters & featured collections  
- Use literary color palette & typography  
- Add About page describing project mission  
- Ensure responsive & accessible design
